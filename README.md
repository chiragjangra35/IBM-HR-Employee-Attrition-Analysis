📊 **IBM HR Analytics: Employee Attrition & Retention Dashboard**

📝 **Executive Summary**
This project focuses on HR Analytics using the IBM HR Attrition dataset. The goal was to identify factors contributing to employee turnover and provide data-driven recommendations to improve retention.

The analysis reveals that Income, Age/Marital Status, and Job Role are the primary drivers of attrition. Specifically, employees with lower monthly incomes, single employees, and those in Sales roles face the highest risk of leaving.
