📝 **Executive Summary**
This project focuses on HR Analytics using the IBM HR Attrition dataset. The goal was to identify factors contributing to employee turnover and provide data-driven recommendations to improve retention.

The analysis reveals that Income, Age/Marital Status, and Job Role are the primary drivers of attrition. Specifically, employees with lower monthly incomes, single employees, and those in Sales roles face the highest risk of leaving.


💼 **Business Problem**
Retaining top talent is a critical challenge for any organization. High attrition rates result in:

Increased recruitment and training costs.

Loss of productivity and institutional knowledge.

Lower employee morale.

Objective: To design a dashboard that helps the HR team monitor attrition rates, identify "flight risk" profiles, and take proactive measures to retain talent.
